This directory contains code derived from JPDA example "tty" debugger.

Main changes here:

* Using org.f3.jdi.F3Bootstrap instead of com.sun.jdi.Bootstrap
- so that F3-JDI connectors are found and used. (Note: on Mac classes.jar
is on bootstrap path and so F3-JDI connectors will not be found unless we
put f3jdi.jar on bootclasspath!. Using F3Bootstrap solves this issue).

* package renaming:
   com.sun.tools.example.debug.expr -> org.f3.tools.debug.expr
   com.sun.tools.example.debug.tty -> org.f3.tools.debug.tty

* TTY.java uses F3-JDI connectors instead of platform (java) connectors.

* Static state of most classes like MessageOutput, Env, ThreadInfo are replaced
with "instance" states and "env" object passed around to get proper state
information. Also, MessageOutput has ability to set output and error streams
with defaults being System.out and System.err respectively.

* Debugger.java - programmatic alternative to TTY.java
